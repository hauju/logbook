For a long time I have been thinking about how I can store and share my knowledge. Finally I decided to start this blog. After further weeks of researching which framework would be the best for me, I decided to use the static code generator [**HUGO**](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and host the blog on [**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/). Some advantages of this setup are as follows.

- The hosting is easy.
- It is completely free of charge.
- I can write my notes in markdown as usual.
- Can use Git as version control.


If you are interested in this, you can find the links below to getting started. Maybe I will post a post a step by step guide of my setup later.
