Hi, my name is Hauke Jung. IÂ´m a Full Stack Software Developer and DevOps Enthusiast. My interests are diverse and range from embedded systems to microservices. The development of new technology progresses exponentially, so I try to focus on the things that excite me. My work at Schueco International KG focuses on the development of a Continuous Integration Toolchain for the execution of automated tests. In my free time, I am currently engaged in the research and development of new posibilities based on distributed ledger technology.

For me, continuous learning is one of the most important characteristics in the field of software development and one reason for me to write this blog. It acts as a kind of a knowledge database for myself, and is maybe for one of you or your team an inspiration.

I am constantly on the lookout for new challenges and interesting contacts. If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Also check out my last posts or visit me on github.
